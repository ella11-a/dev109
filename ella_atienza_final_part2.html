  <h3>What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I did not have any previous knowledge of HTML, CSS, or Javascript. For HTML and CSS, I didn't know what they were and what they were used for. With Javascript, I had an idea that it was a programming language and I have lots of experience with another programming language, Java. This knowledge of Java helped with writing code for Javscript because I already knew the ideas of functions, parameters, actions, etc. I would say I'm pretty well versed in Java, however the different syntax and use of DOM was a little tricky to nail down and understand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch and why?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For my portfolio, I used my Midterm project which was built off of a template from Module 4. This was because I struggled with understanding divs and how they worked and having a basis for my portfolio made it easier to understand how they worked as I could look at the code if I wanted to repeat that same look or add more boxes as seen in the Artifact page and Module Page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There were several challenging parts like structure, design, making sure my images had alt attributes, making sure my pages passed the CSS and HTML validators, etc. I think the most challenging part was design so CSS. I wanted to my each page have the same size font, however my artifact and module pages needed a smaller font for the description. I struggled with figuring this out because I still didn't understand CSS as much as I had thought so I made the mistake of changing the font of the p tag which would obviously change the font for both the artifact and module page which I didn't want. I also struggled with the CSS structure of the div boxes mainly in the module and artifact pages because at first they were not the same size and they were overlapping each other.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How did this class change your view on Web Development?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In the beginning of the class, I hadn't thought too much about web development and the design of each. However, now after approching the end of the class, I definitely am more aware of it and take longer looks at websites and their functionality. Occasionally, I will take a look at their page source too. Web development is certainly something I want to look into further down the future because I can't stop admiring at my final project and thinking about what more I can add to it or what I can design in the future while having fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What would you recommend to future students taking this class?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To future student taking this class, I would say don't be afraid to try things out to just see what happens. I couldn't count the amount of times I went into jsbin just to test out how a certain page would look with a certain color or how a certain layout would look with my HTML formatted a certain way. Honestly, try things out that you are curious about and look them up too. There lots of things out there that you might not expect to be possible from HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</li>
