          <br><a href="https://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=14&coid=57598" target="_blank">Bellevue College Catalog Course - DEV109<br></a>
      <p>Before this class I knew nothing about web development. I didn't know that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were all part web development and I didn't understand how to write or read these languages.
      However, after this class I gained extensive knowledge about each of the languages and am able to create websites like this one.<p>

          <p>Before this class I knew the very basics of java like how to write functions, classes, and understand the basic methods 
            and functions of classes. After this class, I can understand and write severial data structures like arrays, sets, lists, collections, and trees.
          I can also use Big-O notation to determine the performance of a program.

          <p>Before this class I struggled with determining which sequences and series were convergence or divergence. I also didn't know what a vector was. 
            However, after taking this class I am able to determine and prove which series and sequences are convergence or divergence through several tests and am able to 
understand vectors pretty well and their properties.</p>
