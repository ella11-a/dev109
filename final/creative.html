			I love taking photos of sunsets, playing basketball, listening to music, traveling, and so much more. I've been playing basketball ever since I was young with my
				two brothers, my sister, and my dad. We would play pick up during the summer back when I was in elementary and through middle school. I don't play as much anymore
				but I still love the sport. I love music and one of the songs that is on repeat at the moment is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0VF7YLIxSQKyNiFL3X6MmN?si=1067876bb5c34ba3" target="_blank">
				Stargazing</a> by The Neighbourhood. I also recommend <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZDwhNFZnPx9EIPCcwGUHC?si=889d4abf040f406b" target="_blank">Hell N Back (feat. Summer Walker</a>) By Bakar and Summer Walker. I especially love
				Summer Walker's feature. I also love watching movies and anime. One of my favorites is Naruto but Hunter x Hunter is a close second.
